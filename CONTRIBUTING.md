## How to contribute to TOM Toolkit?

### Make a GitHub Issue
Record your bug or feature request as an “Issue” on Github and it will be prioritized and discussed within a week.

### Send us a message on Slack
The TOM Toolkit Slack Workspace is checked regularly, and the #General Channel is a great place to bring up issues and concerns.
